\section*{COMMENTS}
\begin{itemize}
  
\item Page 38: if the infinite product in (1.164) is evaluated correctly, it yields the wrong partition function $\sqrt{\pi} / 2 \sinh (\beta \omega / 2)$. Equivalently, the infinite product formula deduced directly above $(1.165)$ is in fact false. This factor of $\pi$ can be traced back to the numerical factors ignored on page 36. The determinant in (1.154) should contain a factor $m / \pi$ (indeed, there are many missing factors of $m$ throughout Method 2 ). This in turn modifies the first infinite product in $(1.156)$, so that $(1.160)$ should read

\[\zeta_{-(m/\pi)\mathrm{d}^2/\mathrm{d}\tau^2}(s) = \sum_{n \geq 1} \left(\frac{mn}{\beta}\right)^{-2s} = \left(\frac{\beta}{m}\right)^{2s}\zeta(2s).\]

Following this through puts a factor of $\pi / m$ in the first bracket of (1.164), which cancels the $\pi$ in the second bracket (the classical action), as well as the factor $m$ that should have been in the second bracket, to yield the correct partition function. With (1.164) corrected in this way, the derived formula for the infinite product directly beneath it has no factor of $\pi$ in the numerator, as appropriate. Finally, there is also a simple typo in $(1.164)$ - the $\beta \pi$ in the curly brackets should be $\beta \omega$.

\item Page 44: I think the change of variables at the bottom of the page should instead be

$$
\eta_{k}=\left(\theta_{k}+\mathrm{i} \theta_{k}^{\prime}\right) / \sqrt{2}, \quad \eta_{k}^{*}=\left(\theta_{k}-\mathrm{i} \theta_{k}^{\prime}\right) / \sqrt{2}
$$

This makes the equation on the following page correct up to terms symmetric in $i, j$, which vanish on contraction with $a_{i j}$ to yield the correct final expression for the Pfaffian. This change of variables also yields a Jacobian $(-1)^{n}$ which cancels the factor $(-1)^{n^{2}}$.

\item Page $137^{*}$ : in theorem $4.7$ we should talk of a maximal tree rather than the maximal tree, since a maximal tree is far from unique.

\item Page 234: in the proof of (a) of corollary 6.1, we should have that the intersection of the kernels of the $\Lambda\left(\left[c_{i}\right], \cdot\right)$ is $\{0\}-$ each individually can have non-trivial kernel.

\item Page 327: in (8.61) we should view $\tilde{V}^{\mu}(z)$ as a function of $z$ and $\bar{z}$, and consider a perturbation just of $z$; in general the $\tilde{V}^{\mu}$ are not holomorphic functions. We could then also consider $\tilde{V}^{\mu}(z, \bar{z}+\Delta \bar{z})$ - if we choose our connection to have no mixed indices, then for $V^{\mu}$ a holomorphic vector field, this is just equal to $V^{\mu}(z, \bar{z})$.

\item Page 333: example $8.7$ specifically refers to orientable complex manifolds. But we don't need this condition, since all complex manifolds are orientable.

\item Page 334: in defining a Hermitian metric from $\Omega$, we need to show also that the metric is symmetric. This can be shown to follow from the $J$-invariance of any (1,1)-form. The symmetry of the metric is then necessary to prove the Hermiticity of $g$.

\item Page 357: in the definition of a vector bundle, it is stated that "transition functions belong to $\mathrm{GL}(k, \mathbb{R})$, since it maps a vector space onto another vector space". The definition of a fibre bundle only requires that this map is a diffeomorphism, however; the linearity of the map is an additional part of the definition of a vector bundle.

\item Page 370: in defining associated vector bundles we should talk of a $k$-dimensional representation of $G$ rather than the $k$-dimensional representation, since there are generally many representations of a group of a given dimension. Page $371^{*}$ : in $(9.72)$ the structure group should be $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$ instead of the direct sum $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \oplus \overline{\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})}$ - a Dirac spinor does transform under a direct sum representation (note that the fibre is $\left.\mathbb{C}^{4}\right)$, but a direct sum representation of the group $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$. Further, to be completely clear, note that Weyl and Dirac spinors are sections of vector bundles associated to the $\operatorname{SPIN}(k)$ bundle (itself 'lifted' from the orthonormal frame bundle), as opposed to sections of the $\operatorname{SPIN}(k)$ bundle itself.

\item Page 405: in (10.108) there should be a prefactor of $-1 / 2$, not $-1 / 4$, in the first equality, as well as an integration measure $\sqrt{|g|} \mathrm{d}^{4} x$, and prefactor of $-1$, not $1 / 2$, in the second equality (cf. equations $(1.268)$ and $(10.85 a)$ ). This follows from

$$

Equation (10.110) is modified accordingly, retaining the extra sign from the Wick rotation.

\item Page 413: in (10.147) we seek eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian, including both fast and slow degrees of freedom. The energies should thus not be labelled by $\mathbf{R}$, since the eigenstates are functions of $\mathbf{R}$. Further, though the energy is labelled by an integer, this need not be the same integer $n$ as that specifying the eigenstate of the fast degrees of freedom. Thus $E_{n}(\mathbf{R})$ should more appropriately be $E_{m}$.

\item Page 413: in deriving (10.147) from the equation above it, we need to turn $\left\langle\mathbf{R}\left|\nabla_{\mathbf{R}}^{2}\right| \mathbf{R}\right\rangle$ into $\left(\left\langle\mathbf{R}\left|\nabla_{\mathbf{R}}\right| \mathbf{R}\right\rangle\right)^{2}$. This involves inserting a resolution of the identity between the two derivatives. According to $(10.148)$, this amounts merely to inserting $|\mathbf{R}\rangle\langle\mathbf{R}|$, though this is in fact the adiabatic approximation and not the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

In inserting this operator, however, we generate two terms, by the Leibniz rule. One is the desired $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{R})^{2}$ term. The other is a term $\nabla_{\mathbf{R}} \cdot \mathcal{A}(\mathbf{R})$, which is missing from $(10.147)$. In fact, the inclusion of this term is necessary to ensure (10.149) is correct (and it is indeed correct), since upon expanding the brackets we see that (10.149) includes the very derivative of $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{R})$ that ought to have been present in (10.147).

\item Page 435: the comments at the very end of section $11.3 .2$ seem misleading. Characteristic classes themselves certainly can differentiate between two vector bundles of the same space and the same fibre dimension. This is precisely the point of characteristic classes - they classify different bundles with a given fibre over a given base space. Indeed, if the integral of a characteristic class over the base space can distinguish different bundles, then the classes themselves must also be able to also.

\item Page 439: the errors in example $7.14$ have propagated here. Firstly note that $g_{\theta \theta} \neq \sin ^{2} \theta$ as claimed. Further, the trace of $\mathcal{R}^{2}$ should be a trace over Lie algebra indices, that is,

$$
\operatorname{tr}\left(\mathcal{R}^{2}\right)=\mathcal{R}_{\beta}^{\alpha} \mathcal{R}_{\alpha}^{\beta} \quad \text { where } \quad \mathcal{R}_{\beta}^{\alpha}=\frac{1}{2} R_{\beta \mu \nu}^{\alpha} \theta^{\mu} \wedge \theta^{\nu}
$$

as in (7.146b), and not as in the paragraph at the top of the page. In computing the trace, we should not lower the indices on $\mathcal{R}_{\beta}^{\alpha}$, as in this example and in (11.79b). The error in $R_{\phi \theta \phi}^{\theta}$ from example $7.14$ (missing a factor $\sin ^{3} \theta$ ), the error in $g_{\theta \theta}$ (an erroneous factor $\sin ^{2} \theta$ ), and the error in lowering a $\phi$ and a $\theta$ index (an erroneous factor $\sin ^{2} \theta$ in $\left.\mathcal{R}_{\theta \phi} \mathcal{R}_{\phi \theta}\right)$ conspire so that the expression for $\operatorname{tr}\left(\mathcal{R}^{2}\right)$ is in fact correct. Page 445: if we include $\delta t$ both in the definition of $l_{t} \mathcal{F}_{t}$ in $(11.109)$ and in the definition of the homotopy operator $k_{01}$ in $(11.113)$, we will get two factors of $\delta t$ in our integrals, such as in the second line of (11.114), which is nonsense.

\item Page 448: the Bianchi identity (11.124) should hold off-shell, and indeed it does from the definition of $* F$ directly above. Invoking the equations of motion isn't necessary.

\item Page 455: there is one caveat in exercise 12.1. We should have that $D$ is elliptic if and only if $\sigma(D, \xi)=\pm 1$ for at least one choice of sign. For instance, consider the Laplacian multiplied by $-1$. This is surely elliptic, but $\sigma(D, \xi)=1$ has empty solution set.

\item Page 460: the symbol $\sigma(\mathrm{d}, \xi)=\xi \wedge$ obtained in (12.36) is not non-singular for $\xi \neq 0$ as claimed (indeed, the fibre dimensions $k$ and $k^{\prime}$ are generally different), and $\mathrm{d}$ is not an elliptic operator. To apply the index theorem, we should consider the operator $\mathrm{d}+\mathrm{d}^{\dagger}$, which is elliptic, and the two-term complex $\Omega^{\pm}(M)$, as in example $12.2$. As argued in section 12.1.3, this complex has the same index as the de Rham complex.

Since elliptic operators on a compact manifold are Fredholm (see section 12.1.2), we don't need to worry about restricting $\Omega^{r}(M)$ to $H^{r}(M)$, as stated at the bottom of page 460 , since $\mathrm{d}+\mathrm{d}^{\dagger}$ has finite-dimensional kernel and cokernel when acting on $\Omega^{\pm}(M)$. This is just as well, since the AS index theorem as applied in (12.38) involves the characteristic classes of the $r$-form bundle $\wedge^{r} T^{*} M^{\mathbb{C}}$, not some bundle of closed forms.

Put another way, the defining feature of an elliptic complex is not that the differential operators involved are elliptic, as suggested in section 12.1.3. Instead, the defining feature is that the symbol complex is exact, which is to say that the image of $\sigma\left(\mathrm{D}_{r}, \xi\right)$ coincides with the kernel of $\sigma\left(\mathrm{D}_{r+1}, \xi\right)$. This can be shown to hold for the map $\xi \wedge$. Such a definition is motivated by the (non-trivial) result that a complex $(E, D)$ is elliptic if and only if the operator $\mathrm{D}+\mathrm{D}^{\dagger}$, which acts on the even and odd bundles of (12.21), is elliptic. These same comments apply to the Dolbeault complex and equation (12.45).

Page 463: the first line would read better as 'take a $(0, r)$-form $\omega \in \Omega_{p}^{0, r}(M)$ '. Firstly, $\omega$ is not a section but rather the value of a section $\tilde{s}$ at the point $p$. Secondly, the words 'holomorphic' and 'anti-holormophic' as applied to differential forms typically concern the derivatives of the components, as in definition 8.3. Here, however, the word is being used merely to identify $\omega$ as a $(0, r)$-form, as opposed to a general r-form. This usage is analogous to that in the context of tangent vectors; in this case, 'holomorphic' refers to the subspace of the tangent space the vector belongs to (see section 8.2.3).

\item Page 470: in the expression for the topological index in (12.83) there is a missing factor of $(-1)^{m(m+1) / 2}$ on the $\mathrm{RHS}$ (cf. (12.33)). Likewise, on page 467 , in the unnumbered equation for the topological index of the signature complex, I believe the factor $(-1)^{l}$ should instead be $(-1)^{l(2 l+1)}$ (cf. $(12.38)$ ). Both of these factors are inconsequential, however, since both indices are zero unless $m=0 \bmod 4$.

\item Page 496: in (12.183) it is stated that $e^{-\beta \omega / 2} \sinh (\beta \omega / 2)$ tends to one as $\omega$ goes to zero. This is plainly false. Indeed it appears that the determinant of $\mathrm{d} / \mathrm{d} t$ is in fact zero. The only resolution I can see is to use the independence of the index of $\beta$ to take the limit $\beta \rightarrow \infty$ before taking $\omega \rightarrow 0$, which gives the desired limit for the determinant.
